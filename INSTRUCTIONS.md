Instructions
============

Congratulations!  You've downloaded MIST and you want to get it running.
Here are some basic instructions that we hope will allow you to do just
that.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Install npm (node package manager).
- Run a local MongoDB server. Follow these instructions (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) to install the Community server. We also recommend downloading MongoDB Compass (https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to view your database. If you experience issues connecting to MongoDB (e.g., through Compass or when running npm start), check that the MongoDB server is running on your machine.
- Open a terminal. Move to the backend folder, and run "npm install".
- Open a new terminal. Move to the front end folder, and run "npm install".

Running MIST locally
--------------------
- Run "npm start" in the backend folder.
- When you see "running on port 8000" in the terminal, move to another terminal, and run "npm start" in the frontend folder.
- Open localhost:3000 to access MIST.
