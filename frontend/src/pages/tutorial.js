              In this video we will go over the basic ideas of MIST!
              <br />
              After this, you will have a better understanding of how variables
              and functions are getting translated to the cool images that you
              can create with MIST.
              <br />
              All images in MIST are drawn on a square canvas.
              <br />
              We have an x and a y axis, just like in math class!
              <br />
              X values range from -1 at the left to 1 at the right. Y values
              range from -1 at the top to 1 at the bottom (This is different
              from what you have experienced in math class!).
              <br />
              Numbers also represent colors. Since we're working in the range -1
              to 1, we must assign a meaning to each number. We'll start with
              greyscale images. In greyscale, the value 1 represents the color
              black (or lots of ink). Conversely, -1 is white.
              <br />
              And anything between -1 and 1 is grey.
              <br />
              Here's an image in which each color depends on the x coordinate.
              <br />
              We would write this as x.
              <br />
              We can apply mathematical operations, too. Here's what happens
              when we multiply x times y. (Don't worry about how we're writing
              it; you'll use a graphical user interface to build images.) You've
              learned the basics of the MIST world. It's time to start making
              your own images.

              Welcome to a tour of the MIST website!
              <br />
              To start off, this is the home page. There are many different
              routes you can take here, from looking at other peoples' images to
              creating your own. Let's begin with the create page, which you can
              get to by clicking "create" on the top left of the page on the
              menu bar.
              <br />
              <WorkSpace /> 
              On the create page, you can make your own images using the
              workspace on it.
              <br />
              Next is the challenges page, which can also be found by clicking
              the button beside "create." Here, you can click on a challenge,
              which is an image that you try to recreate!
              <br />
              After this, we're going to go to the tutorial page, which is the
              page that we're currently on if you're reading this!
              <br />
              Next up is the gallery. With the gallery, you can see what other
              people have created. Here, you can click on images to learn more
              about it. You can see who created the image, how many favorites it
              has, you can save or share, or view or add a comment!
              <br />
              After this, we can look at the About MIST and development page.
              This explain what MIST is about!
              <br />
              We can also go to the community guidelines page. This explains the
              guidelines for using MIST and being a respectful of other peoples
              <br />
              Next we can go to the FAQ, which is still under the "About" tab.
              <br />
              Use the "Sign In/Up" tab to login or sign up for MIST!
              <br />
              You can use the search bar in the top right corner to look up
              users, images, and albums!

            <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>constants</b> are values in MIST that are
            inputted into functions or even used on their own.
            <br />
            The <b>X</b> variable ranges from -1 to 1 based on the x-values.
            This means that from left to right, the colors of this block change
            white to black. This is because x-values change horizontally.
            <br />
            The <b>Y</b> variable ranges from -1 to 1 based on the y-values.
            Remember that for <b>Y</b>, -1 starts at the top and 1 is at the
            bottom. Therefore, white is at the top and slowly turns black, which
            comes from y-values changing hoizontally.
            <br />A constant is a value that doesn't change, hence the name
            constant. For example, if we had the value <b>2</b>, it would always
            remain as <b>2</b>.

            In order to get an animation, you'll have to connect a time variable
            to your workspace! This includes the blocks <b>t.s</b>, <b>t.m</b>,{" "}
            <b>t.h</b>, <b>t.d</b>. These are divided by increasing times, with
            s standing for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, and d for days.
            <br />
            Adding time causes the image to become an animation. This is because
            time passes, it changes the input and therefore changes the image.
            <br />
            Time and animations can be manipulated. You can add them, multiply
            them, or change them with other functions and this speeds up or
            slows down the animation.
            <br />
            To show an example of this:
            <br />
            1. Add an <b>x</b> and <b>t.s</b> variable to the workspace.
            <br />
            2. Drag in a <b>mult</b> block and connect the <b>x</b> and{" "}
            <b>t.s</b> to it. Now you can see time changes what was once a a
            simple <b>x</b> image.
            <br />
            3. To change the speed of the animation, bring in a <b>
              constant
            </b>{" "}
            variable and set it equal to 2. Connect this to the <b>mult</b>{" "}
            block that is already there and see how the speed changes. It should
            move much quicker now!

            Moving with the mouse means that you can change what the image looks
            like just by moving your mouse around on the image. In order to do
            this, the <b>m.x</b> block, <b>m.y</b> block, or both must be used.
            <br />
            The <b>m.x</b> block changes the colors along the x-values. You can
            try it yourself by opening the preview for <b>m.x</b> and moving
            your mouse from side to side over it!
            <br />
            The <b>m.y</b> block changes the shades from white to black across
            the y-values. This is because the y-values refer to the vertical
            values in math!
            <br />
            To try it yourself:
            <br />
            1. Bring a <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>,<b>m.x</b> and <b>m.y</b> variable
            into the workspace.
            <br />
            2. Then add a <b>wsum</b> in and connect all 4 variables to it. You
            should have a simple animation that moves when you hover over it!

            Multiple input functions are functions that must have at least 2
            inputs and can have up to 20. These functions include <b>sum</b>,{" "}
            <b>wsum</b>, <b>mult</b>, and <b>avg</b>.
            <br />
            The <b>sum</b> function adds numbers together. It sums together
            numbers up to -1 and 1. For example, if you add together 0.5 and
            0.7, it will stay equal to 1.
            <br />
            The <b>wsum</b> (wrap sum) function works similarly to how{" "}
            <b>sum</b> does. However, instead of maxing out at 1 or -1, it wraps
            back around.
            <br />
            The <b>mult</b> block lets you multiply two or more numbers
            together. Using the example multiplying x and y together, you can
            see in the top left corner, that it is black because -1 x -1 is 1.
            Then, if you look at the bottom left corner, it is black
            <br />
            The <b>avg</b> function averages together values. For example, the
            average of -1 and 1 is 0.
            <br />
            To use this yourself try:
            <br />
            1. Adding an <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> variable to the workspace.
            <br />
            2. Then add a <b>sum</b> block and a <b>mult</b> block in.
            <br />
            3. Connect the <b>x</b> to the <b>sum</b> block twice, and then the{" "}
            <b>y</b> to the <b>mult</b> twice.
            <br />
            4. Then bring in an <b>avg</b> block and connect the <b>sum</b> and{" "}
            <b>mult</b> block to it! Now take a look at your final image!

            Fixed input functions mean that the number of inputs is unchanging.
            This includes blocks for <b>sqr</b>, <b>neg</b>, <b>sin</b>,{" "}
            <b>cos</b>, <b>abs</b>, <b>sign</b>, <b>if</b>.
            <br />
            <b>Sqr</b> stands for squaring a number or variable. This means that
            multiplying a variable like x by itself twice is the same as
            squaring it once.
            <br />
            <b>Neg</b> means negative, this changes the input from positive to
            negative, or if the input was already negative, it would change it
            to a positive output.
            <br />
            <b>Sin</b> and <b>cos</b> stand for sine and cosine, which are
            trigonometric functions. To see a difference, drag an <b>x</b> and{" "}
            <b>y</b> variable into the workspace. Next, add a <b>sin</b> and{" "}
            <b>cos</b> block to connect to each. Here, you can see how they
            differ.
            <br />
            <b>Abs</b> is absolute value. This turns anything that is negative
            or positive into its positive counterpart. For example, the absolute
            value of -1 is one, whereas the absolute value of 1 is also 1.
            <br />
            <b>Sign</b> is used to round values. Every value below 0 gets
            rounded to -1 and every value equal to or greater than 0 gets
            rounded to one. This also means that there will be no gray areas in
            the image you make!
            <br />
            <b>If</b> blocks work by taking 3 inputs. To see for yourself:
            <br />
            1. Drag a <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> variable into the workspace along
            with an <b>if</b> block.
            <br />
            2. Connect the <b>x</b> to the first two nodes of the <b>if</b>{" "}
            block.
            <br />
            3. Then, connect the <b>y</b> variable to the third node of the{" "}
            <b>if</b> block. In this example , the test case, which is the first
            input, is <b>x</b>. So while the input is less than 0, the returned
            value is negative, which means that it calls <b>y</b>. When it
            reaches 0 or greater, it returns positive, which in this case is x.
            This is why the image looks "split" in this case.

            The <b>RGB</b> function adds color! <b>RGB</b> is defined by three
            components: red, green, and blue. These components are the primary
            colors in a pixel on your screen that can be mixed by varying
            degrees so that other colors can be made. It helps to think about
            RGB in terms of mixing light rather than mixing paint colors in that
            the more you add, the closer you get to white light.
            <br />
            To the right is an example of solid red, represented by a 1 in the
            red component's position and -1 in the green and blue positions.
            Meaning that the amount of red in the light mixture is at its
            highest and the amounts of green and blue are at their lowest.
            <br />
            Together, these all change the color. If the <b>RGB</b> function is
            given 1, 1 and 1, it will interpret these numbers as pure white
            since in our [-1,1] world these are our highest values. Given -1,-1
            and -1, <b>RGB</b> would show pitch black. Within the limits of our
            world, adding more of any of the three components will change the
            'amount' of that color in the mixture.
            <br />
            To make your own colorful image, try this!
            <br />
            1. Start by adding an <b>x</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>y</b> to your
            workspace.
            <br />
            2. Drag in a <b>mult</b> block and connect y to it twice.
            <br />
            3. Add a <b>sin</b> and connect the <b>x</b> to it.
            <br />
            4. Finally, bring in a <b>RGB</b> block. Connect the <b>mult</b>{" "}
            block to the red, the x to the green, and sign to the blue. Check
            out your colorful image!

            For a rhombus, we’re going to add <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> blocks.
            <br />
            1. First, add the variable <b>x</b> and values <b>1</b> and{" "}
            <b>-1</b> to the workspace.
            <br />
            2.Then, bring in an <b>if</b> statement.
            <br />
            3. When connecting to the <b>if</b> statement, make sure it goes in
            the correct order! This is very important. Connect the <b>x</b> to
            the first node of the if statement.
            <br />
            4. Then, connect <b>-1</b> to the second node. This means that if x
            is a positive number or 0, it will return this -1.
            <br />
            5. After that, connect <b>1</b> to the third node. If the input is
            less than 0, it will return 1. This is why when you click the
            preview for if, the right side is white and the left side is black.
            You can see what it should look below!
            <br />
            6. Next, add <b>x</b> and a <b>value</b> block to the workspace. Set
            the value of this block equal to <b>2</b>.
            <br />
            7. Bring in a <b>mult</b> block and connect the <b>x</b>, the{" "}
            <b>2</b>, and the <b>if</b> block to it. If you look at the preview
            now, you can see how it has changed!
            <br />
            8. Now repeat steps 1-7, but this time using <b>y</b> instead of{" "}
            <b>x</b>. This will change the pattern from a vertical split to a
            horizontal one. We'll write the steps below just in case (or jump to
            step 12).
            <br />
            9. Connect a <b>y</b>, <b>-1</b>, and <b>1</b> to an <b>if</b>{" "}
            block, in that order, just like in step 3 to 5. It should look like
            this.
            <br />
            10. Then add another <b>y</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>mult</b> block.
            <br />
            11. Connect the <b>y</b>, <b>2</b> and previous <b>if</b> block to
            the <b>mult</b> block.
            <br />
            12. After this is completed, let’s add a <b>sum</b> block. Connect
            this to the <b>mult</b> blocks we used with <b>x</b>, and with{" "}
            <b>y</b> to it.
            <br />
            13. We’re also going to add another value block and set it to{" "}
            <b>2</b>. Then, connect it to the sum block. We should now have a
            diamond shaped rhombus outline!
            <br />
            14. To make this image more clear, we’re going to add a <b>
              sign
            </b>{" "}
            block. Connect <b>sum</b> to <b>sign</b> and click the preview; you
            should see a rhombus!

            Resizing can be useful when trying to get an image to look a certain
            way. The easiest way to alter the size of an image inside the canvas
            is to include a constant. Let's go through an example of that!
            <br />
            1. Start by making a triangle. Click{" "}
            <Link to="#triangle">here </Link> for the triangle tutorial!
            <br />
            2. Add a constant and set it equal to <b>-0.5</b>.
            <br />
            3. Connect this to the <b>sum</b> block.
            <br />
            4. Bring a <b>sign</b> block into the workspace.
            <br />
            5. Connect the <b>sum</b> block to it. See how the triangle got
            smaller!

            will learn how to move this image along the x and y axis (vertically
            and horizontally).
            <br />
            1. To move the circle horizontally, we have to add or subtract some
            value from the <b>x</b> value. In this case we are adding <b>0.5</b>
            .
            <br />
            2. When finishing this up, you get a circle that is slightly to the
            left. Now try moving it to the right!
            <br />
            3. Similarly to the horizontal example, to move the circle
            vertically, we have to add or subtract some value from the <b>y</b>y
            value. In this case we are adding <b>0.5</b> to <b>y</b>.
            <br />
            4. When finishing this up, you get a circle that is slightly up. Now

            You might have created some cool pictures by now. In this tutorial
            you will learn how to put them together into one piece. To do so, we
            need to use the if function. Let’s say you have the following 3
            images:
            <br />
            And you want to make it into the following:
            <br />
            It uses the circle outline, and uses the second picture as the
            inside of the circle and the third picture as the outside of the
            circle. You just need to connect them together with an if function:
            <br />
            Remember what if does? It takes 3 inputs in -- 3 images. It uses the
            second image in all the positive parts of the first image, and the
            third imagery all the negative parts of the image.
            <br />
            In the above example, the second image (y) is being used at the
            positive parts (black parts) of the first image (the circle).
            Whereas the third image (the triangle) is being used at the negative
            parts (white parts) of the first image (the circle).
            <br />
            So how would it look like if the order was the following with the
            following images:
            <br />
            (These are the same images as in the previous one except the circle
            is blended.
            <br />
            It looks the following:
            <br />
            This is because sign changes all negative parts into white, and
            positive parts into black. By adding a sign function on the first
            image input, you will have an easier time seeing through the
            different parts of the image and the exact dividers.
            <br />
            You can also think in quadrants, like in math with graphs and
            coordinates. For example you can use four different images to make
            the following:
            <br />
            It makes up of the following four images:
            <br />
            1. Make each of these shapes:
            <br />
            2. Then connect the upper 2 together with an <b>if</b> function, and
            the bottom 2 together with an <b>if</b> function, while using{" "}
            <b>y</b> as the first image in both cases. You can see that the
            upper image is made up of the upper two images, and the bottom one
            is made up of the bottom two images. They are also being divided up
            horizontally in the middle. This is how it would look like:
            <br />
            3. Now, we can connect these two images together based on the{" "}
            <b>x</b> image. Since the <b>x</b> function divides the image up
            vertically in the middle, it uses the first image’s right part, and
            the second image’s left part.

            Here is an example of a colorful image using many of the skills you
            just learned!
            <br />
            1. To start, add an <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>t.s</b> variable to
            the workspace.
            <br />
            2. After this, bring in a <b>sin</b> and <b>cos</b> block. Connect
            the <b>x</b> to <b>cos</b> first then <b>sin</b>. If we click on the
            previews for <b>sin</b> and <b>cos</b>, we can see how the
            differences in how they look!
            <br />
            3. Now, let’s add another <b>sin</b> block and connect the{" "}
            <b>sin</b> from the previous step to it.
            <br />
            4. Next, we’re going to drag in a <b>mult</b> block. Let’s connect
            the <b>sin</b> block and the <b>y</b> variable to it!
            <br />
            5. Add a <b>wsum</b> block. We’re going to connect <b>t.s</b> and{" "}
            <b>y</b> to this.
            <br />
            6. Finally, connect this to an <b>rgb</b> block. We’ll start at the
            top, with <b>sin</b> being red, the <b>mult</b> block going to
            green, and <b>wsum</b> connecting to blue. Now look at this colorful
            animation you just made!

            Here is an example of an interesting and slightly more challenging
            image. It incorporates many aspects from the previous tutorials. To
            begin:
            <br />
            1. Start by adding an <b>x</b> and a <b>y</b> variable.
            <br />
            2. Next, add a <b>sqr</b>, <b>mult</b>, and <b>neg</b>. Connect the
            <b>x</b> to the <b>sqr</b> and <b>mult</b> and the <b>y</b> to the{" "}
            <b>mult</b> and <b>neg</b>.
            <br />
            3. Then bring in another <b>neg</b> block and connect the <b>sqr</b>{" "}
            to this.
            <br />
            4. Add a <b>t.s</b>, <b>m.x</b>, and <b>m.y</b>.
            <br />
            5. Connect the <b>t.s</b> and <b>m.y</b> to the new <b>mult</b>{" "}
            block in the workspace. and it.
            <br />
            6. On their own, the images look simple, but now it's time to put it
            all together. Start by adding a<b>wsum</b>. From there, connect both
            of the <b>neg</b> blocks and <b>mult</b> blocks. Additionally,
            connect the <b>m.x</b> block to the <b>wsum</b> block as well.
            <br />
            7. Finally, connect the <b>wsum</b> to a new <b>sin</b> block and
            check out the final image!
